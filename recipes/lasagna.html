        <h2>Description</h3>
        <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
            Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
            This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <h3>For the meat sauce:</h2>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <h3>To assemble the lasagna:</h2>
            <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of 
                tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives 
                the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using 
                ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese 
                blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more 
                sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used 
                up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
        </ol>
